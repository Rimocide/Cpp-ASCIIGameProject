there are images in your head you cannot understand, to the extent that you could not even call
them images. You waken slowly on a floor that is cold and hard, but it feels as if your senses 
are scrambled. As if you can't map what feelings belong to what words in your head. \0

Slowly you begin to recognise the objects around you. Legs to workspace tables,the lights 
at the bottom of the computer clusters blinking listlessly. A chair lies at your feet as well.
The only explanination you can think of for this situation is having fallen asleep and somehow 
rolling off the chair.\0

As your head begins to clear, you wonder why none of your crewmates noticed you 
lying on the floor, almost panicking you think to look for them. \0

After all, without them you'd be floating through the vast cold expanse of space, billions of
kilometers from home, alone. \0
