As you step into the testing lab, the first thing that strikes you is the eerie silence. 
The room is brightly lit, but there's no one else here. 
You're alone, surrounded by the sterile white of the walls and floors.
You can feel the weight of the vacuum of space pressing against the walls of the vessel, 
reminding you of your small and fragile place in the universe.
The room is dim and shadowy, filled with scientific instruments and equipment. 
The walls are lined with shelves and cabinets, containing an array of chemicals, samples, and tools.
